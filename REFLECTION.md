### CS 81 Module 5 Assignment 5B: My Week in Data, GregH, 7/14/25

#### Were your predictions accurate?

Yes.

#### What surprised you about your week?

I'm sorry; I racked my brain for something slightly unexpected in my data, but I can't find anything. So I'll share this surprise, which happened gradually over the last several months: I thought that computer programming classes would start with learning the language, and then shift, perhaps gradually, to focusing on using what we had learned to solve increasingly complex problems by writing increasingly complex code. Instead, even in Advanced Java class, we are still learning more features of the language, while also learning more complex pre-written algorithms. And mind you, Intro to Java starts with an assumption of knowing how to program in C.

All my programming classes have been like that. That's not a complaint, just a realization that there's more to learning computer programming than I expected.

#### Which higher order function was most useful and why?

I don't want to give a definitive answer to this question, because map(), reduce(), filter(), and forEach() were each crucial for different parts of the assignment. But it looks like I used filter() the most often, and that makes sense to me, because the most interesting insights available in data are usually not calculations performed on the entire set, but on certain parts of it, e.g., "Let's learn more about the data points with (insert any particular characteristic)." And that's what filter() is designed for.
